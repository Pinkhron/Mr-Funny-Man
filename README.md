# Mr. Funny Man

A semi-annoying Discord bot.

## Setup For Yourself:

1. Download Node.js from https://nodejs.org and doanload the latest verstion. This will run the code for you and install npm, which we will use later. Make sure to add it to PATH in the installer.
2. Download git from https://git-scm.com so you can clone the project. **Make sure in the installer you ad git to PATH.** If you don't put it in PATH then I'll explain the other way too.
3. Create a folder somewhere on your PC and open VSCode (If you don't have VSCode, then you can download it from here https://code.visualstudio.com)
4. On the top of the VSCode window select Terminal then click open new terminal
5. Once your in the terminal, type "git clone https://github.com/Pinkhron/Mr-Funny-Man" and if you didn't install git in PATH then go into File Explorer, go into the folder you created for your project, then right click then click "open git bash here" after that type the command above in there.
6. In the same terminal run "npm i" then if you want to make changed to the ts files or config files, then run "npm run tsc"
7. Once you've cloned the project, you are free to do anything you want with it. Make sure to edit the config.json to change the channel IDs and the webhooks.
8. Go to https://discord.com/developers/docs then on the left click applications. Create a new application then go to bot and click "create bot".
9. Copy the token of the bot and create a file on VSCode and name it ".env" then add a line that displays (ex. TOKEN=ABC123)
10. Once your done with all of that, then you are able to run your bot now! Simply type in the terminal "node out/index.js".
11. You are now done!

If you need help then you can contact me on Discord.

## Notes:

All webhooks are deleted, so don't try using them for yourselves.
